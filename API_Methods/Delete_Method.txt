The DELETE method in Postman is used to remove a resource from the server. It sends a request to a specific endpoint to delete the identified resource.

Key Characteristics:

* DELETE is idempotent: repeating the same request typically has the same effect as the first (deleting the same resource again has no further impact).
* It usually doesn’t require a body, but some APIs might accept one.

Common Response Codes:

* 200 OK – The resource was successfully deleted and may return a confirmation message or resource metadata.
* 202 Accepted – The deletion request has been accepted but is being processed asynchronously.
* 204 No Content – The resource was successfully deleted, and there is no content to return.
* 400 Bad Request – The request is malformed or missing required parameters.
* 401 Unauthorized / 403 Forbidden – Authentication or permission issues.
* 404 Not Found – The resource to be deleted does not exist.
* 409 Conflict – The resource could not be deleted due to a conflict (e.g., dependencies or constraints).

Using DELETE in Postman:

1. Choose the DELETE method from the dropdown.
2. Enter the API endpoint URL (often includes a resource ID, e.g., `/users/123`).
3. Add any required headers (e.g., `Authorization`).
4. (Optional) Add a body if the API expects it.

Let me know if you’d like a sample DELETE request or to test one with a mock API.
