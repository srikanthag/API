The PUT method in Postman is used to update or replace an existing resource on the server. It sends data to a specific endpoint, typically along with a request body (usually in JSON format), to update the resource.

Key Characteristics:

* PUT is idempotent: making the same request multiple times results in the same state on the server.
* Commonly used to update existing records.

Common Response Codes:

* 200 OK – The request was successful, and the resource was updated.
* 201 Created – Sometimes used if the resource is created as a result of the PUT request (though usually POST is preferred for creation).
* 204 No Content – The update was successful, but there's no content in the response.
* 400 Bad Request – The request is malformed or invalid.
* 401 Unauthorized / 403 Forbidden – Authentication/authorization issues.
* 404 Not Found – The resource to update does not exist.
* 409 Conflict – Conflict in resource state (e.g., concurrent updates).

Use Postman to test PUT methods by:

1. Selecting the PUT method.
2. Entering the endpoint URL.
3. Adding required headers (e.g., `Content-Type: application/json`).
4. In the Body tab, selecting raw and entering the JSON data.

Let me know if you’d like a real example.

PUT  https://reqres.in/api/users/7
Body (raw / JSON):

{
    "id": 7,
    "email": "tracey.ramos@reqres.in",
    "first_name": "SrikanthAG",
    "last_name": "1234",
    "avatar": "https://reqres.in/img/faces/6-image.jpg",
    "updatedAt": "2025-07-13T04:32:59.737Z"
}
Expected Response:

* 201 Created with the new user data.
